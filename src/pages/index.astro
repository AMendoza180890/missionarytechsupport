        We would love to support what the Lord is doing in your ministry through
        the gifts He has given us. We believe that He gave us these talents for
        two reasons: to share and to empower. We would love to share these gifts
        with your ministry and empower your team by teaching these skills that
        you may use going forward.

          <p>
            Storytelling is an important part of any ministry. Our team can take
            photos, write stories, and spread the word of all that God is doing
            through your work. We can give social media training, document
            testimonies in a newsletter, and aid in the crafting of fundraising
            campaigns.
